# ExampleCode
This is my first official C++ project, which uselessly helps you store Memes in a very basic "Data Base" that I created.
I highly doubt anyone will come accross this, but if you're reading this, sorry for the bad code.

This was developed with Visual Studio 2022.*

*If you want to test the code in MSVS 2022, make sure that in the project's properties, in the Linker>>General tab you set the Force File Output to /FORCE:MULTIPLE
